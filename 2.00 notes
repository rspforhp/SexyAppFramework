**THIS APPLIES TO THIS UPCOMING RELEASE ONLY**

** A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT:**
This new DLL originally was 1.40, as a LIB,  but there is actually a 1.70 available but has NOT been leaked to github yet.  So what we are doing is making this v2.00 for this reason...
For the very first time you will no longer need to include this library via the linker settings inside your executable project...HOWEVER:
You will still need to specify the headers to be included in your C++ include directories...so this way the WinMain entry point is minimized to the "construct only" philosophy, instead of busting ass in
